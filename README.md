# ETHIOPIAN-FOOD-RECIPE
Introduction 
Ethiopian cuisine (Amharic: የኢትዮጵያ ምግብ) characteristically consists of vegetable and often very spicy meat dishes. This is usually in the form of wat a thick stew, served atop injera, a large sourdough flatbread which is about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in diameter and made out of fermented teff flour.[ Ethiopians  eat most of the time with their right hands, using pieces of injera to pick up bites of the injera ,stews and side dishes
